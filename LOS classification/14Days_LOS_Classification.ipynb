        "# Notebook Summary: 14Days_LOS_Classification\n",
        "This notebook, originally generated by Google Colab, implements a machine learning workflow for classifying hospital length of stay (LOS) in diabetic patients using data from a 14-day observation window. The key steps include:\n",
        "\n",
        "## Setup & Imports:\n",
        "The notebook begins by installing and importing necessary libraries such as scikit-learn, XGBoost, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, and Optuna for hyperparameter tuning.\n",
        "\n",
        "##Data Loading & Preprocessing:\n",
        "It loads a CSV dataset (\"MC_merged.csv\"), drops irrelevant columns, and defines the target variable (binary classification: below median vs. above median LOS).\n",
        "The code distinguishes between pattern-based features (columns with specific prefixes) and baseline features, then constructs three datasets: one with only pattern-based features, one with only static features, and one with a combined set.\n",
        "\n",
        "##Model Training & Evaluation:\n",
        "The notebook optimizes and trains three classifiers—Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost—using Optuna for hyperparameter tuning.\n",
        "For each classifier, it splits the data into training and testing sets, performs necessary scaling (especially for SVM), and in the case of XGBoost, applies SMOTE to handle class imbalance.\n",
        "\n",
        "##Performance Metrics:\n",
        "For each model and feature set, evaluation metrics including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and AUC-ROC are computed and printed, allowing for a comprehensive comparison of model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook is part of a broader research effort to assess how temporal abstraction and feature integration can improve LOS classification accuracy. All code, along with detailed hyperparameter optimization and evaluation routines, is made available in this notebook for reproducibility and further research exploration"
