        "#Notebook Summary: 7Days_LOS_Classification\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook, originally generated in Google Colab, implements a machine learning workflow to classify hospital length of stay (LOS) for diabetic patients using data from a 7-day observation window. Key aspects include:\n",
        "\n",
        "##Setup & Imports:\n",
        "The notebook installs and imports essential libraries such as scikit-learn, XGBoost, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, and Optuna for hyperparameter tuning.\n",
        "\n",
        "####Data Loading & Preprocessing:\n",
        "The dataset (\"MC_merged.csv\") is loaded and preprocessed by dropping irrelevant columns and defining a binary target variable (below vs. above median LOS). The features are split into two groups: pattern-based features (identified by specific column prefixes) and baseline features. Three different feature sets are then created: one with only pattern-based features, one with only static features, and one combining both.\n",
        "\n",
        "##Model Training & Evaluation:\n",
        "The notebook trains three classifiers—Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost—using Optuna for hyperparameter optimization. For each classifier, the data is split into training and testing sets; scaling (particularly for SVM) and SMOTE (for handling class imbalance in XGBoost) are applied as necessary. The models are evaluated on metrics including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and AUC-ROC.\n",
        "\n",
        "##Performance Metrics:\n",
        "The evaluation metrics provide a comprehensive comparison of the classification performance using the 7-day data, helping to assess the impact of temporal features and feature integration on LOS prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook is part of a broader research effort to assess the utility of temporal abstraction and feature integration for LOS classification. All code and procedures are provided for reproducibility and further exploration."
